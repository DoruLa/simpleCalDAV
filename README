1. About

simpleCalDAV is a php library that allows you to connect to a calDAV-server to get events and TODOs from
the server, to change them, to delete them, to create new ones, etc.
simpleCalDAV was made and tested for connections to the CalDAV-server Baikal 0.2.7. But it should work
with any other CalDAV-server too.

It contains the following functions:
  - simpleCalDAVconnect()
  - simpleCalDAVdelete()
  - simpleCalDAVcreate()
  - simpleCalDAVchange()
  - simpleCalDAVgetEventsByTime()
  - simpleCalDAVgetTODOsByTime()
  - simpleCalDAVgetByUID()

All of those functions are realy easy to use, self-explanatory and come with a big innitial comment, which
explains all needed arguments and the return values.

This library is heavily based on AgenDAV caldav-client-v2.php by Jorge López Pérez <jorge@adobo.org> which
again is heavily based on DAViCal caldav-client-v2.php by Andrew McMillan <andrew@mcmillan.net.nz>.
Actually, in contrast to caldav-client-v2.php by Jorge López Pérez I hardly added any features. The main
point of my work is to make everything straight forward and easy to use. You can use simpleCalDAV whithout
a deeper understanding of the calDAV-protocol.


2. Requirements

Requirements of this library are
  - The php extension cURL ( http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php )
  - From Andrew’s Web Libraries: ( https://github.com/andrews-web-libraries/awl )
     - XMLDocument.php
     - XMLElement.php
     - AWLUtilities.php


3. Installation

Just download
  - from Andrew’s Web Libraries:
     - XMLDocument.php: https://github.com/andrews-web-libraries/awl/raw/master/inc/XMLDocument.php
     - XMLElement.php: https://github.com/andrews-web-libraries/awl/raw/master/inc/XMLElement.php
     - AWLUtilities.php: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrews-web-libraries/awl/master/inc/AWLUtilities.php
and move them in the same directory as simpleCalDAV.php and caldav-client-v4.php

Assure yourself that cURL is installed.

Import simpleCalDAV.php in your code and you are ready to go ;-)
